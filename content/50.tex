\section{Installation}
There is a significant list of packages that you can download on the website of MongoDB: \url{www.mongodb.com}. 
Depending on operating system and processor of your server, you can choose a version and release channel of MongoDB. \parencite{Membrey2014}.

\subsection{Requirements e.g. configfiles}
The most important part is the operating system, just as MacOS, Solaris, Windows, Linux, etc. 
The second part, it depends on, is the bit version of your  system: 32-bit or 64-bit.
Important: Not every system supports every bit-version.
But the most important thing is the software itself, just as I wrote at the beginning.
The different versions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Community Server (open-source version of MongoDB)
    \item Enterprise Server (the commercial version of MongoDB, which is available with a paid subscription)
\end{itemize}
and release channels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stable Release (provides access to the most recent stable version of MongoDB)
    \item Release Candidate (provides access to the upcoming version of MongoDB that is being prepared for release)
    \item Development Release (provides access to the latest development version of MongoDB, which includes new features and functionality that are still being tested)
\end{itemize}

For guarantying that every function and feature can be fully used, there are some supported platforms, with a list including all information, so you know if a version is available on your system.
You can view this information on the MongoDB installation page in the docs: \url{https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/} \parencite{Membrey2014}.

MongoDB supports a few platforms: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Amazon Linux V1 and V2
    \item Debian 9, 10, 11
    \item RHEL/CentOS, Oracle Linux, Rocky, Alm a 9.0+, 8.0+, 7.0+, 6.2+
    \item SLES 12, 15
    \item Ubuntu 22.04, 20.04, 18.04, 16.04
    \item Windows Server 2019, 2008/2012/2012R2, 2016
    \item Windows 10
    \item macOS 11, 10.14+, 10.13, 10.12, 
\end{itemize}\parencite{Mongo-Installation}

\subsection{Linux server}

\subsubsection{Installation through Repositories}
So if you want to download MongoDB on Linux, you have got two different ways to go:
The first one installs MongoDB through the Repositories, it will install the packages automatically. 
In Ubuntu the default repositories includes MongoDB, the version might be out-of-date\dots


\subsubsection{Installation Manually}



\subsection{Docker}
