\section{Recommendation and Conclusion}

\subsection{Recommendation for specific use cases}
MongoDB is a good choice for applications that need to store large amounts of structured or % semi-structured in Quelle?
unstructured data and thus require a scalable solution \parencite{Mongo-Why}.
\\
Since MongoDB is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data, it is an excellent choice for analytics platforms \parencite{Mongo-Scale}. 
\\
MongoDB is also well-suited for IoT applications, as it can quickly and efficiently store many unstructured 
data points from a variety of devices \parencite{Mongo-IoT}.
\\
MongoDB can also be useful for e-commerce applications, as it allows for fast transaction 
processing and provides flexible data modeling \parencite{Mongo-E-Commerce}. 
\\
MongoDB is also well-suited for mobile applications, as it is lightweight and allows for fast data processing \parencite{Mongo-Mobile}. 
\\
Furthermore, MongoDB is commonly used for real-time applications that are executed at different locations \parencite{Jayasekara2021}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
MongoDB is a powerful and very popular NoSQL database. Like any document oriented database,
it is very flexibility and thus allows developers to quickly create new features and models 
without worrying about strict schemas and relationships between the data \parencite{Mongo-Scale}. 

Another important advantage of MongoDB is its integration with many modern technologies and 
frameworks. MongoDB provides drivers for many programming languages and is also available on many 
cloud platforms, making implementation easier and faster \parencite{Mongo-Integration}.

Furthermore, MongoDB has also developed a cloud-based platform called Atlas that allows customers 
to host and manage their MongoDB instances in the cloud. Atlas also provides features such as 
automatic scaling and backups that make managing MongoDB databases easier \parencite{Mongo-Deploy-database}.

Regarding the CAP theorem, MongoDB is considered as a CP database \parencite{Jayasekara2021}.

Overall, MongoDB is a powerful database that is suitable for many use cases 
and is continuously evolving to meet the requirements of modern applications.
