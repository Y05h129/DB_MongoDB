\section{Position according to CAP}

According to Brewer it is not possible to have all three properties at the same time. 
The CAP theorem includes consistency (C), availability (A), and tolerance to network partitions (P) as its components \parencite{Brewer2000}.
The use case for MongoDB is very common for real-time applications that are executed at different locations \parencite{Jayasekara2021}.

%partition tolerance
Replica sets lay the foundation for high availability and redundancy. With multiple replications of the data to different database servers a partition tolerance is provided.
Occasionally, replication offers the advantage of increasing read capacity, as the read accesses are distributed across different servers.
Maintaining data copies at different server locations can increase data locality and availability. In addition, data copies can be used for example as backups \parencite{Mongo-Replication}.

%consisteny single master nodes,  master write and slave read




% availability clusterstruktur shards replica sets




MongoDB is considered as a CP database, because it focuses on consistency across the entire system and partition tolerance \parencite{Jayasekara2021}.

% %read and write concerns
% %causal consistency
% If there is a logical link between processes, this is also referred to as a causal relationship. MongoDB performs causal operations considering the causal relationships. 
% The clients therefore only see consistent results with these relationships. 
% To ensure this causal consistency, the order of the reads must be reflected in the order of the writes \parencite{Mongo-Consistency}.

% MongoDB has been continuously running — and passing — Jepsen tests for years. Recently, we have been working with the Jepsen team to test for causal consistency. 
% With their help, we learned how complex the failure modes become if you trade consistency guarantees for data throughput and recency.
